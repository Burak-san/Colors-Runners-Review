## Indroduce
*Hi:punch:,I'm from Turkey,and I do game development.*
*It is the post-revision version of the project I developed with my own team. It is a project that was created because I wanted to write all the codes alone from the beginning. The mechanics, add-ons and design models used in this project are listed below. Have a nice day.*
